      <h2>Eadgyth help (still in progress)</h2>
      <h4>Requirements</h4>
      <p>The Java runtime environment must be version JRE 8 to run Eadgyth.</p>
      <p>For a Java project it is required that a Java development kit (JDK)
         is installed and the computer is set up to use the JDK. For the JDK
         of Oracle, see:      
         <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html">
         Oracle JDK</a>. Also, the filepath of the JDK must be saved in the
         &lsquo;settings.properties&rsquo; file in the program folder. If this is not
         done in the file itself already, the program asks to enter the filepath in a
         dialog the first time it is tried to compile source files or if a new version
         of the JDK was installed.</p>
      <h4>Configuring and testing a Java project</h4>
      <h5>Project settings</h5>
      <p>The setting of a project always starts from an existing file that is opened
         (or newly saved) and is in the selected tab. The file is found in a directory
         that is supposed to be the project's root or in sub-directories of this root,
         i.e. a separate directory for sources and/or a package.</p>    
      <ol>
         <li>Open a java source file or save an unnamed tab as a java source file.</li>
         <li>Open the settings window using &lsquo;Project settings&rsquo; in the menu
             &lsquo;Project&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>Enter the name of the source file that contains the main method in the text
             field &lsquo;Name of main program file&rsquo; (without extension). The main
             file does not have to be the opened file.</li>
         <li>If the main file is part of a package enter the package name in the text field
             &lsquo;Package with main class&rsquo;. If it is located in a sub-package
             enter the path with normal file separators (slash in Windows).</li>
         <li>If the directory that contains source files (or packages) is not supposed
             to be the project's root but a separate sources directory the name of this
             directory is entered in text field &lsquo;Sources directory&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>A separate destination directory for compiled class files maybe entered in the
             text field &lsquo;Executables directory&rsquo; (the folder will be created
             during compilation).</li>
         <li>Click ok. If entries are correct the project can be viewed in the &lsquo;Project
             explorer&rsquo; that is opened in the &lsquo;View&rsquo; menu.</li>
      </ol>    
      <h5>Compiling and running a project</h5>
      <ol>
         <li>Compile the source file(s) using &lsquo;Save all and compile&rsquo; in the
             &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu. If errors occur you will be asked to open the
             console to view messages.</li>
         <li>If the compilation was successful the new program can be run for testing by
             using &lsquo;Run&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu (this will also open the
             console panel). The tested program can be forcibly quit using the &lsquo;stop&rsquo;
             button of the console panel.</li>
         <li>Arguments for a start script may be entered in the text field &lsquo;Arguments&rsquo;
             (separated by single spaces) in the Settings window</li>
         <li>A jar file may be created by using &lsquo;Build&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Project&rsquo;
             menu.</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Other projects than Java?</h5>
      <ul>
         <li>A project maybe also defined for a txt file (which only allows viewing files in the
             project explorer) or for a file that contains HTML code. The latter can be viewd in
             a web browser (the default browser) by using &lsquo;Run&rsquo; in the
             &lsquo;Project&rsquo; menu. The keyword coloring for html code is so far very
             rudimentary though.</li>
      </ul>  
      <h5>Changing between projects</h5>
      <ul>
         <li>Different projects may set. A new project is set by opening a file that is not part
             of the currently active project and then opening the settings window
             (&lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Project settings&rsquo;). The new file must be found
             in the selected tab.
         <li>Changing between already set projects is done by selecting a file that is part of
             the project to be set active and using &lsquo;Project&rsquo; > &lsquo;Change
             project&rsquo;.      
      </ul>
      <h4>Using the console</h4>
      <p>The console area shall show messages after compilation of a project and the output of a
      program that is tested. Interactive programs can be run too, at least Java programs.</p>
      <p>In addition, self-chosen system commands entered in a dialog can be run in the current
      working directory (a project's root directory if a project is set). For example, a created
      jar file may be tested by the command  java -jar SomeProgram.jar. A run process can be
      forcibly quit using the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; button.</p>
      <p> Note that the console does not work as the terminal of the operating system. However,
      it is possible (or rather not prohibited) to run the system's terminal in the console by
      running the command that starts the terminal (e.g., cmd.exe in Windows). It is only important
      to note that a tested program thereupon started from this terminal cannot be forcibly quit
      using the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; button.</p>
      <h5>To run a system command...</h5>
      <ol>
         <li>Open the console panel in the menu &lsquo;View&rsquo;.</li>
         <li>Press the button &lsquo;Cmd...&rsquo; and enter a command in the shown dialog window.
              Click ok in the dialog window to run the command.</li>
         <li>To run a previous command press the &lsquo;>&rsquo; button; to change a command open
             the command dialog again by pressing the &lsquo;Cmd...&rsquo; button.
      </ol>
      <h5>Further options</h5>
      <ul>
         <li>A new instance of Eadgyth can be run from the console by pressing the button with
             the Eadgyth icon. One reason to do this would be to view the output when a new plugin
             is tested.</li>
      </ul>
