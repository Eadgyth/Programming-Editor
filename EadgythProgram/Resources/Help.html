         <p>For a programming project the computer is set up in the same way as if any
            text editor is used for coding and the tested program would be run from a command
            interpreter. Presently, programming projects can be defined for Java and Perl.</p>

         <!--Run project-->
         <h3 id="RunProject">Running a project</h3>
   
         <h4 id="ProjectTypes">Types of projects</h4>
         <p>The following types of projects may be defined and would be recognized based
            on the file extension:</p> 
         <ol>
            <li><a href="#JavaProject">Java</a> (file extension is .java) 
            <li><a href="#PerlProject">Perl</a> (file extension is .pl, .pm)
            <li><a href="#HtmlProject">HTML</a> (file extension is .html, .htm)
         </ol>
   
         <h4 id="Config">Configuring a project</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>For a new project open a file or save a new file that has one of the file
                extensions mentioned above.</li>
            <li>Open the settings window by selecting 'Project' > 'Project settings'.</li>     
            <li>Enter the name of the main source file without extension. The main file does
                not have to be the opened file but must exist.</li>
            <li>If the main file is part of a package (for Java) enter the package name in
                the text field 'Package containing the main class'. If it is located in a
                sub-package enter the path with normal file separators.</li>
            <li>If the directory that contains source files (or packages) is not supposed
                to be the project's root (i.e. the working directory) but a sub-directory for
                sources the name of this directory is entered in text field 'Name of sources
                directory'.</li>
            <li>A separate destination directory for compiled files (for Java) maybe entered 
                in the text field 'Name of executables directory'. This folder will be created
                during compilation in the root directoy.</li>
            <li>Click ok. If entries are correct, the project can be viewed in the 'Project
                explorer' that is opened by selecting 'View' > 'Project explorer'.</li>
            <li>The field 'Name of project root' does not have to be filled. However, entering
                a name enforces that determined root directory matches this name. The text field
                anyway shows the name of the root when the settings window is newly opened or if
                a previous project is <a href="#Retrieve">retrieved</a>. It must be cleared (or
                modified) if the project root is to be changed.</li>
         </ol>
   
         <h4 id="ChangeProjects">Changing between projects</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>Different projects may set during a session. A new project can be set by selecting
               'Project' > 'Project settings' if a file that is not part of the currently active
                project is in the selected tab.</li>
            <li>A project inside the directory structure of an active project may be defined by
                selecting 'Project' > 'New settings for interlaced project' if the file in the
                selected tab belongs to a currently active project.</li>
            <li>Changing between already set projects is done by selecting a file that is part of
                the project to be set active and then selecting 'Project' > 'Change project' or,
                to switch project and view or alter the settings, 'Project' > 'Project
                settings'.</li>
         </ul>
   
         <h4 id="Retrieve">Retrieving projects</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>The project that was active when the program was closed the last time is retrieved
                and set active when a file of that project is opened (or one is newly saved to
                that project) and no other project is already active. The extension of the file must
                correspond with the type of project (See <a href="#ProjectTypes">Types of projects</a>).
                The extension may be different if and only if the language is set correspondingly
                under 'Edit' > 'Language'.</li>
            <li>If 'Save eadconfig file' is selected in the settings window the configuration of the 
                project is stored in such config file. This is saved in the project folder but can
                be deleted at any time by unselecting the option to save it. A project is, in a way,
                "marked" as one by the presence of the eadconfig file which merely means two things:<br>
                <ol>
                   <li>If a file of a marked project is opened (or one is saved to that project) the
                      settings are loaded even if another project is active. Selecting 'Project' >
                      'Change project' can be used to change to that project or 'Project' > 'Project
                      settings' to additionally view or alter the retrieved settings.</li>
                   <li>A marked project is directly set active if a file of that project is opened and
                      no other project is active even though that project was not necessarily active
                      lastly when the program was closed.</li>
                </ol>   
         </ul>
   
         <h4 id="Language">Setting the language</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>The language defines the syntax coloring which firstly depends on the extension of the
                file that is opened or newly saved (for the file types .java, .pl, .pm, and .html).</li>
            <li>Setting the language by selecting 'Edit' > 'Language' takes effect only in unnamed
                tabs.</li>
            <li>Setting the language may also determine which input options are shown in the project
                settings windows. For example, a file with "wrong" extension but what is supposed to
                belong to a Java project (some resources file, maybe) may be just selected. Opening
                the settings window would show the "correct Java" options if the language was set to Java.
                However, the file extension that cooresponds to a project type has always the priority</p>                   
         </ul>
   
         <h4 id="JavaProject">Testing Java code and packing a jar file</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Compile the source file(s) using 'Save open files and compile' in
                the 'Project' menu. If errors occur it will be asked to open the console panel to view
                messages.</li>
            <li>If the compilation was successful the new program can be run for testing by
                using 'Run' in the 'Project' menu. Any output and error
                messages from the tested program are displayed in the console panel. In the case
                that the program asks for input through a command line the console area is writable.
                The tested program can be forcibly quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol in
                the toolbar of the console panel.</li>
            <li>Arguments for a start script may be entered in the text field 'Arguments'
                (separated by single spaces) in the settings window ('Project' > '
                Project settings').</li>
            <li>A jar file may be created by selecting 'Project' > 'Create
                jar'. The jar file is saved in the executable's folder or, if no such folder
                is defined, in the project's root folder. A name for the jar file can be specified
                in the settings window. If no name is given the jar name is the same as the name of
                the main class. Note that presently only class files can be bundled in a jar.</li>
         </ol>
   
         <h4 id="PerlProject">Testing a Perl script</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Save changes to the script and select 'Run' in the 'Project'
                menu.</li>
            <li>Any output (error) is shown in the console panel. NOTE: there is a limitation when the
                script asks for input through a command line. In that case any output from the script
                expected before user input is asked for (like "Enter your name:") is not printed (more
                precisely it's printed only after inputs were made). The output would be shown as
                expected (as far as tested) if the autoflushing of Perl's STDOUT is turned on in the
                script itself. The other possibilty is, of course, to start the command line/terminal
                of the OS to test the script (see <a href="#Console">Using the console</a>).
            <li>Arguments for a start script may be entered in the text field 'Arguments'
                (separated by single spaces) in the settings window ('Project' > 'Project settings').</li>
            <li>The syntax coloring for Perl is presently very basic.</li>
         </ol>
   
         <h4 id="HtmlProject">Viewing HTML code in a web browser</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Save changes to the file and select 'Run' in the 'Project' menu to view the html file in
                the default web browser. Any file in the root folder, not just the project file specified
                in the settings window, can be viewed.</li>
            <li>As for Perl code, the syntax coloring is presently rudimentary.</li>
         </ol>
   
         <hr>
   
         <!--Console-->
         <h3 id="Console">Using the console</h3>
         <p>The console area shall show messages after compilation of a project and the output of
            a program that is tested.</p>
         <p>In addition, self-chosen system commands entered in a dialog can be run in the current
            working directory (the project's root directory). A run process can be forcibly quit by
            clicking the 'stop' symbol.</p>
         <p>The console does not emulate the terminal of the operating system though. However,
            it is possible (or rather not prohibited) to run the system's terminal in the console
            by running the command that starts the terminal (e.g., cmd.exe in Windows). It is
            important to note that a tested program thereupon started from this terminal CANNOT be
            forcibly quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol.</p>
         <p>Hint: using the command to start 'THE' terminal (in Windows this would be
            cmd.exe /c start) presets the working directory for the terminal to the project's root
            directory.
   
         <h4>To run a system command...</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Open the console panel in the menu 'View'.</li>
            <li>Press the button 'Cmd..' and enter a command in the shown dialog window.
                klick ok in the dialog window to run the command.</li>
            <li>To run a previous command press the '>' button; to change a command open
                the command dialog again by clicking 'Cmd...'.</li>
         </ol>
   
         <h4>Further options</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>A new instance of Eadgyth can be run from the console by pressing the button with
                the Eadgyth icon in the toolbar of the console panel. One reason to do this would
                be to view the output when a plugin is tested.</li>
         </ul>
   
         <hr>
   
         <!--File explorer-->
         <h3 id="Explorer">Using the project explorer</h3>
         <p>The project explorer can be opened by selecting 'View' > 'Project explorer' once a
            project is defined.<br>
            The explorer always shows the project that is currently set active. A few operations
            are supported:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The project's file system is shown as a tree in which folders are expanded or
                shrunk by clicking the (+), (-) handles, as usual. However, a double left
                click on a folder symbol does not expand/shrink the folder but displays a new
                tree rooted at the clicked folder. To move back the 'Folder up' symbol
                is clicked. The topmost level is always the project's root directory.</li>
            <li>A double left click on a file opens the clicked file in a new tab.</li>
            <li>A file may be deleted after a right click on a file symbol and selecting
                'delete'. If the deleted file is in an open tab, the tab is
                not closed but goes into 'Save as' mode.</li>
            <li>A folder may be as well deleted after a right click on a folder symbol but
                a folder is protected from deletion if it is not empty. The exception is, if
                present, the folder for executable files or its subfolders. This may be
                deleted for a completely renewed compilation</li>
            <li>A new folder may be created after a right click on a folder symbol and selecting
               'Create new folder'.</li>
            <li>Changes to the project's file structure made from within the program should be
                updated in the file view (no guarantee). Changes made from outside the program
                would be updated "manually" by clicking the 'refresh' symbol.</li>
