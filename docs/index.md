I started to make this text editor when I started to learn Java for myself and wished that NotePad
had a compile and a run button. I am still learning and struggling …

A goal is that it is as simple as possible to set up the editor to to try out code by the built-in
functions. There should be at the same time some flexibility. For example, if I want to run my first
‘Hello World’ program it’s only nessecary to give the editor the name of the Java file and the name
of the directory where this file is found. However, it is as well possible to run a "real" Java
project with a package strucure and also separate directories for sources and compiled class files.
The editor is written with itself, for eample. The languages for which a ‘run’ function is built-in
are rather limited now. These are there like to demonstrate that the program can be extended to
support other languages (in principle any kind of project category).
