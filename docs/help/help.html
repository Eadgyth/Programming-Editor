      <p>For a programming project the computer is set up in the same way as if any text
         editor (like Notepad) is used for coding and the tested program would be run
         from the command-line interface of the OS. This may also mean to set environment
         variables for the used programming language.
      </p>
      <p>To compile Java files by the pre-defined compile option (as opposed to using the
         command-line interface of the OS or the option to start system commands in the
         console of the program) it must be made sure that the program is run using the
         Java Runtime environment (JRE) contained in the Java Development Kit (JDK).

      <!--Project-->
      <h2 id="Projects">Working with projects</h2>
      <p>Assigning a project initially just means to define a working directory to
         distinguish "project files" from "non-project files" and to define the directory
         where commands are executed.

      <h4 id="Config">Assigning files as project</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Open a file from or save a new file to the directory that is the presumed root
          directory of the project. The file may also be saved in a sub-directory or a
          sub-directory path contained in that root. Assigning a project only requires
          that a (any) file that is contained in the project directory is open and also
          is in the selected tab if multiple files are open.</li>
      <li>Open the project settings window by selecting 'Assign as project' in the
          'Project' menu and choosing a project category. The input options depend on
          the project category. The required entries are the name of the project root
          directory and, in the categories in which a main file is used to run a tested
          program, the name of the main file. In addition, it may be possible that the
          main file (or generally source files) are stored in a separate directory that
          is a sub-directory of the project root (a source folder). In this case the
          name of this directory is specified in the input field 'Name of sources
          directory'. For Java this directory must not be a directory that is also
          defined as a package.</li>
      <li>Make the required entries in the input field(s) and click ok.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>

      <h4 id="ChangeProjects">Adding projects and changing between projects</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>'Assign as project' in the project menu may be selected to assign an additional
          project. For this a file that is part of the new project must be currently
          open and also in the selected tab if multiple files are open.</li>
      <li>Changing between already set projects is done by selecting, opening or saving a
          file that is part of the project to be changed to and then selecting 'Change
          project' or, to additionally view or modify the settings, 'Project settings'
          in the 'Project' menu.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h4 id="Retrieve">Retrieving projects</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>The project that was active when the program was closed the last time is
          retrieved and set active when a file of the project is opened (or a new
          file is saved to the project) and no other project is already active. Also,
          the recent project is shown in the project explorer.</li>
      <li>If 'Save ProjConfig file in the project' is selected in the project settings
          the parameters for the project are stored in the project folder. This
          properties file can be deleted at any time by unselecting the option to save
          it.<br>
          A project is marked as such by the presence the ProjConfig file. This means
          that a project is loaded even if it was not active lastly or other projects
          are already active. Loading the project again takes place if a file of the
          project is opened (or a new file is saved to the project). If another project
          is already active, it is asked to change to the newly loaded project.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="RunCode">Running source code</h2>
      <p> A project is run for testing by selecting 'Run project' in the Project menu
          or by clicking the run button in the toolbar. Commands other than the
          pre-defined commands may be entered in the console (see:
          <a href="#Console">Using the console</a>). Any output and error messages
          from a tested program are displayed on the console window. A tested program
          can be forcibly quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol in the tool bar of the
          console.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4 id="JavaProject">Run Java code and create an executable jar file</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>To run a Java program first compile the source file(s) by selecting 'Save
          selected file and compile project' or 'Save all open project files and compile
          project' in the project menu. If it is specified to save compiled class
          files in a separate directory (executables directory in the project settings)
          this folder may be deleted in the project explorer for a renewed compilation.</li>
      <li>An executable java archive (jar) may be created by selecting 'Create jar' in
          the project menu. A name for the jar file can be specified in the tab
          'Compilation and build' in the project settings. The jar is saved in the
          project directory unless a pathname is specified to save it to another
          location. This path may be relative to the project directory or also a full
          path to save the jar to a directory outside the project directory.</li>
      <li>Files other than .java files and .class files can be included in a compilation
          and a jar, resepctively. Extensions of included files are specified with the
          beginning period in the input field 'Extensions of included non-Java files'
          which is found in the tab 'Compilation and build' in the project settings.</li>
      <li>Libraries may be specified in the tab 'Libraries' in the project settings.
          These are added in classpath of the program and can be jar files or folders
          containing class files. Classpath can be a path relative to the project
          directory (e.g. libs/x.jar) but also an absolute path. When the program is
          packaged in a jar the paths are added to the CLASS-PATH header in the
          manifest file as specified. To use libraries stored in the project it is
          recommended to store project source files in separate sources directory
          and to specify a separate directory for class files (executables directory
          in the project settings).</li>          
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h4 id="PerlProject">Run a Perl script</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Save changes to the Perl script and start it by selecting 'Run'.</li>
      <li>Options and arguments for the start command may be entered in the input
          fields 'Command options' and 'Command arguments', respectively, which are
          found in the tab 'Run' in the project settings.</li>
      <li>The Perl script may be checked for correct syntax without running it by
          by selecting 'Save selected file and compile project' or 'Save all open
          project files and compile project' in the 'Project' menu (starts the script
          with the -c option).
          </li>  
      <li>NOTE: For correct output of a Perl program to the console window it may be
          necessary to turn of buffering of the standard output in the script (e.g. by
          adding $| = 1 at the beginning of the script).</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h4 id="PythonProject">Run a Python script</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Save changes to the Python script and start it by selecting 'Run'.</li>
      <li>Options and arguments for the start command may be entered in the input fields
          'Command options' and 'Command arguments', respectively, which are found in
          the tab 'Run' in the project settings.</li>
      <li>NOTE: For correct output of a Python program to the console window it may be
          necessary to specify a command option that turns off buffering of the standard
          output and standerd error (-u).</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h4 id="RProject">Run an R script</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Save changes to the R script and start it by selecting 'Run'.</li>
      <li>Options and arguments for the start command may be entered in the input
          fields 'Command options' and 'Command arguments', respectively, which are
          found in the tab 'Run' in the project settings. The script is run by using
          the Rscript command.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h4 id="HtmlProject">Viewing HTML code in a web browser</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Save changes to the HTML file that is currently open and in the selected tab
          if multiple files are open. Selecting 'Run' in the project menu shows the HTML
          file in the default web browser.</li>

      <!--Console-->
      <h2 id="Console">Using the console</h2>
      <p>The console shall show messages after compiling a project (applies to Java) and
         the (error) output of a program that is tested.</p>
      <p>In addition, self-chosen system commands entered in a dialog can be run in the
         current working directory (the project directory).</p>
      <p>A run process can be forcibly quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol.</p>
      <p>NOTE: The console does not emulate the terminal of the operating system!
         However, it is possible (or rather not prohibited) to run the system's terminal
         in the console by running the command that starts the terminal (e.g., cmd.exe in
         Windows). It is important to note that a tested program thereupon started from
         this terminal CANNOT be forcibly quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol as this
         would only end the terminal.</p>
      <h4>To run a system command...</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Open the console panel by selecting 'Console' in the View menu.</li>
      <li>Press the button 'Cmd...' and enter a command in the shown dialog window. Click
          ok to run the command.</li>
      <li>To run a previous command press the run button button (in the tool bar of the
          console; to change a command open the command dialog again by clicking 'Cmd...'.
      </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Hints</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>Using the command to start "THE" terminal window (in Windows this would be
          cmd.exe /c start) presets the working directory for the terminal to the
          project directory. To run a program in the CMD (again Windows) and keep the
          CMD open the command would be cmd.exe /c start cmd /k [command].</li>
      <li>The option to enter commands may be used to run batch files saved in the
          working directory (in Windows the command would be cmd.exe /c [BatchFile.bat]).
      </li>
      </ul>

      <!--File explorer-->
      <h2 id="Explorer">Using the project explorer</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>The project explorer is opened by selecting 'Project explorer' in the View
          menu. It shows the file system of a project once one is assigned or, if given,
          that of the recent project.</li>
      <li>The explorer always shows the project that is currently set active. The topmost
          directory that can be navigated to is always the project root.</li>
      <li>A folder or file may be deleted after a right click on a folder or file and
          selecting 'Delete'. However, folders that are not empty are protected from
          deletion. The exception is, if present, the folder for executable files. This
          may be deleted for a renewed compilation (applies to Java projects).
      </li>
      <li>A new folder may be created after a right click on a folder and selecting
         'Create new folder'.
      </li>
