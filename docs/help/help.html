      <p>For running source code (and maybe compiling) the computer must be set up in the
         same way as if any text editor (like Notepad) is used for coding and the code
         would be run from the command-line interface of the OS. This may also mean
         to set environment variables for the used programming language.
      </p>
      <p>To compile Java files by the pre-defined compile option (as opposed to using the
         command-line interface of the OS or the option to start system commands in the
         console of the program) it must be made sure that the program is run using the
         Java Runtime environment (JRE) contained in a Java Development Kit (JDK).

      <h2 id="Projects">Setup to run source code</h2>      
      <h4>Setting a project</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Open a file from or save a new file to the directory that is the presumed root
          directory of the project. The file may also be saved in a sub-directory or a
          sub-directory path contained in that root. Assigning a project only requires
          that a (any) file that is contained in the project directory is open and also
          is in the selected tab if multiple files are open.</li>
      <li>Open the project settings by selecting 'Settings for...' in the 'Project' menu
          and choosing a category to open the project settings.</li>
      <li>The input options for setting a project depend on the
          <a href="#Categories">category</a>. The required entries are the name of the
          project directory and, in the case that a main source file/script is used to run
          the project, the name of this "main" source file. Click ok. If the input was
          correct the files of the project can be viewed in the 'Project explorer' which
          is opened from the 'View' menu.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>

      <h4>Adding projects and changing between projects</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>Several projects may be created. To set up an additional project 'Settings for...'
          in the 'Project' is selected while a file that is found in the directory of the
          new project is currently open and also in the selected tab if multiple files
          are open.</li>
      <li>Changing between already set projects is done by selecting, opening or saving a
          file that is part of the project to be changed to and then selecting 'Change
          project' in the 'Project' menu or clicking the corresponding button in the
          toolbar.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h4>Retrieving projects</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>The project that was active when the program was closed the last time is
          retrieved and set active when a file of the project is opened (or a new
          file is saved to the project) and no other project is already active. Also,
          the recent project is shown in the project explorer.</li>
      <li>If 'Save ProjConfig file in the project to retrieve settings' is selected
          in the project settings the parameters for the project are stored in the
          project folder. This properties file can be deleted at any time by
          unselecting the option to save it.<br>
          A project is marked as such by the presence the ProjConfig file. This means
          that a project is loaded even if it was not active lastly or other projects
          are already active. Loading the project again takes place if a file of the
          project is opened (or a new file is saved to the project). If another project
          is already active, it is asked to change to the newly loaded project.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="JavaProject">Java</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>To run a Java program first compile the source file(s) by selecting 'Save
          and compile' in the 'Project' menu (or clicking the corresponding button
          in the toolbar). If the compilation was successful the Java program is
          started by clicking 'Run' in the 'Project' menu or the corresponding button
          in the toolbar.
          NOTE: If it is specified to save compiled class files in a separate sub-directory
          (an executables directory) this folder may be deleted using the project explorer
          for a renewed compilation. </li>
      <li>An executable java archive (jar) may be created by selecting 'Create
          executable jar' in the 'Project' menu. A name for the jar file can be
          specified in the tab 'Compilation and build' in the project settings. The
          jar is saved in the project directory unless a pathname is specified to save
          it to another location. This path may be relative to the project directory or
          also a full path to save the jar to a directory outside the project directory.</li>
      <li>Files other than .java files and .class files can be included in a compilation
          and a jar, resepctively. Extensions of included files are specified with the
          beginning period in the input field 'Extensions of included non-Java files'
          which is found in the tab 'Compilation and build' in the project settings.</li>
      <li>Libraries may be specified in the tab 'Libraries' in the project settings.
          These are added to classpath and can be jar files or folders containing class
          files. Classpath can be a path relative to the project directory (e.g.
          libs/some.jar given this file exists in the project directory) but also an
          absolute path. When the program is packaged in a jar the paths are added to
          the CLASS-PATH header in the manifest file as specified.</li>          
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4 id="PerlProject">Perl</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>A Perl script is started by selecting 'Save and run' (or by clicking
          the corresponding button in the toolbar).</li>
      <li>The Perl script may be checked for correct syntax without running it by
          by selecting 'Save and compile' (this starts the script with the -c
          option).</li>  
      <li>NOTE: For correct output of a Perl program to the console window it may be
          necessary to turn of buffering of the standard output in the script (e.g. by
          adding $| = 1 at the beginning of the script).</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4 id="PythonProject">Python</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>A Python script is started by selecting 'Save and run' (or by clicking
          the corresponding button in the toolbar).</li>
      <li>NOTE: For correct output of a Python program to the console window it may be
          necessary to specify a command option that turns off buffering of the standard
          output and standerd error (-u). This switch can be entered in the project
          settings in the field 'command options' which can be found in the 'run' tab.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4 id="RProject">R</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>An R script is started by selecting 'Save and run' (or by clicking the
          corresponding button in the toolbar). The script is run by using
          the Rscript command.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4 id="HtmlProject">HTML</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>An HTML file is viewed in the default browser by selecting 'Save and run'
          (or by clicking the corresponding button in the toolbar).
          Any HTML file that is located in the project directory can be viewed. The
          viewed file is the currently open file or the file in the selected tab if
          multiple files are open.</li>

      <!--Console-->
      <h2 id="Console">Using the console</h2>
      <p>The console shall show messages after compiling a project (applies to Java) and
         the (error) output of a program that is tested.</p>
      <p>In addition, self-chosen system commands entered in a dialog can be run in the
         current working directory (the project directory).</p>
      <p>A run process can be forcibly quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol.</p>
      <p>NOTE: The console does not emulate the terminal of the operating system!
         However, it is possible (or rather not prohibited) to run the system's terminal
         in the console by running the command that starts the terminal (e.g., cmd.exe in
         Windows). It is important to note that a tested program thereupon started from
         this terminal CANNOT be forcibly quit by clicking the 'stop' symbol as this
         would only end the terminal.</p>
      <h4>To run a system command...</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>Open the console panel by selecting 'Console' in the View menu.</li>
      <li>Press the button 'Cmd...' and enter a command in the shown dialog window. Click
          ok to run the command.</li>
      <li>To run a previous command press the run button button (in the tool bar of the
          console; to change a command open the command dialog again by clicking 'Cmd...'.
      </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Hints</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>Using the command to start "THE" terminal window (in Windows this would be
          cmd.exe /c start) presets the working directory for the terminal to the
          project directory. To run a program in the CMD (again Windows) and keep the
          CMD open the command would be cmd.exe /c start cmd /k [command].</li>
      <li>The option to enter commands may be used to run batch files saved in the
          working directory (in Windows the command would be cmd.exe /c [BatchFile.bat]).
      </li>
      </ul>
